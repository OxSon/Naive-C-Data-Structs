## This is a repository holding my first-try implementation of various data structures written in C, for the purposes of getting familiar with C.

That is, they are all written by somebody (me) brand new to the language and memory mangement in general.
I don't claim that any of these structures are *good* implementations much less *ideal* implementations. Feedback or notes are welcomed in the issues.

###Currently have:
+ Linked list (singly linked)
+ Stack (linked list implementation)

Thanks for looking!
